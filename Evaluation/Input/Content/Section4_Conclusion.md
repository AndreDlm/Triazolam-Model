The final triazolam PBPK model applies metabolism by CYP3A4, modelled as two separate pathways yielding Î±-hydroxy-triazolam and 4-hydroxy-triazolam as metabolites. Overall, the model adequately describes the observed PK of triazolam in healthy, non-obese adults receiving different single IV or PO doses of triazolam.
